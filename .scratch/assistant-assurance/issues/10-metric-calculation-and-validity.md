# Metric semantics, deterministic calculations and raw validity

Status: needs-triage
Type: task
Blocked by: reliability contract review; 01 for computed schema; 02 for raw evidence

## Scope

Implement [reliability contract](../reliability-contract.md) sections 2–3 across
P0/P1/P2/P4/P7. Add versioned metric/formula definitions over existing services,
bounded computed dependencies and server rendering. Preserve raw missing/validity
masks before legacy sanitization. Validate convergence/coverage and domain-specific
physical/accounting checks; maintain input assumptions and uncertainty labels.
Do not confuse source agreement with independent calculation validation.

## Test-first acceptance

Required groups: **A1.7, A2.9, A2.10, A4.6, A7.7** in [test matrix](../test-plan.md).
Use hand-worked raw inputs and independent arithmetic: snapshot-weighted energy,
multi-period duplicate indices, objective/cost bridge, signed deltas/denominators,
complete-population predicates and non-converged/missing versus zero. Inject
plausible erroneous service results and check invariants/metric identity. Test
same semantics in answers, charts/tables and reports. Never derive expected values
by calling the service under test or copying its response.

## Completion and handoff

Done only with reviewed per-metric validity/formula/tolerance/fixture mappings,
required green public-seam cases and relevant result/harness regressions. Domain
rules must be independently reviewed for each released metric. Record pending
metrics explicitly in [ledger](../coverage-ledger.md) and [handoff](../session-handoff.md).

## Comments

Initial source targets: `services/results/losses.py` zero-filling and denominator
handling; `routers/results.py` cost/objective definitions; report value-only audit.
This is a planning ticket, not a claim those application paths have been fixed.

Implementation continuation (2026-10-10): The generator-dispatch/1 candidate now independently calculates energy, marginal expenditure and peak output from raw per-metric masks, capacity bounds and matching optimal-LP provenance. Full cost accounting, the proposed 230 EUR same-basis fixture, cross-domain/report parity and independent domain review remain pending. See [implementation status](../implementation-status.md). This is editing-agent prototype coverage, not inherited independent approval or whole-ticket completion.
