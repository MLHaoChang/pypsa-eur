# pypsa-gui Chatbot Assistant

The chatbot panel embeds an in-app copilot powered by the Anthropic Messages
API. It can answer questions about the open network, drive every backend
tool the GUI itself exposes, and gate destructive / execution actions
behind explicit user confirmation.

## Setup

The assistant is **off** until two prerequisites are met:

1. The `anthropic` Python package is installed (pulled in by
   [backend/requirements.txt](backend/requirements.txt) — runs
   `pip install -r requirements.txt` from a fresh checkout).
2. The `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` environment variable is set in the backend
   process. Either export it in your shell before launching uvicorn, or
   drop it into a gitignored `.env` file the backend reads at startup.

If either is missing the panel renders disabled and surfaces
`error_kind='missing_api_key'` or `error_kind='sdk_not_installed'`
explaining the gap. Setting the key requires no restart of the frontend.

The `/api/chat/health` endpoint reports `anthropic_api_key_present` without
ever echoing the key value, so you can probe the backend's view safely.

## Models

The header dropdown selects the model used for the next turn:

| Model | Identifier | When to use |
|---|---|---|
| Sonnet 4.6 (default) | `claude-sonnet-4-6` | Quick reads, single-tool calls, low-cost iteration. |
| Opus 4.8 | `claude-opus-4-8` | Multi-step model design, complex reasoning, dependent tool chains. |

Switching models takes effect on the *next* turn; an in-flight stream
continues on the previous model.

## Cost meter (M10)

The header shows the running token totals and a derived EUR estimate:

```
12,345 in / 6,789 out · €0.0234
```

The server only ever reports token counts; the EUR figure is derived
client-side from the per-model price constants in
[frontend/src/store/chatStore.ts](frontend/src/store/chatStore.ts). When
Anthropic ships a price update, bump `PRICING_USD_PER_MTOK` and
`PRICING_VERSION`. **No EUR field is ever written to chat.jsonl**, so
re-pricing a historic conversation is a pure render-time computation.

## Cost caps

The server enforces hard ceilings — once a cap is hit the stream emits
`session_done` with `reason='budget_exhausted'` (or, for the per-turn cap,
`tool_call_cap_exceeded`):

| Cap | Default | Constant |
|---|---|---|
| Output tokens / turn | 8,192 | `MAX_OUTPUT_TOKENS_PER_TURN` |
| Tool calls / turn | 25 | `MAX_TOOL_CALLS_PER_TURN` |
| Turns / session | 100 | `MAX_TURNS_PER_SESSION` |
| Output tokens / session | 200,000 | `MAX_OUTPUT_TOKENS_PER_SESSION` |

All four live as module-level constants in
[backend/services/chat_service.py](backend/services/chat_service.py); tune
them per deployment.

## Confirmation flow

| Tool tier | Card? | Typed confirmation? |
|---|---|---|
| `read` | no | no |
| `write` | no | no |
| `destructive` | yes (5 min TTL) | only for the highest-risk tools (see below) |
| `execution` | yes (5 min TTL) | no |
| `execution_long_running` | yes (5 min TTL) | no |

Tools that surface a **typed-confirmation** widget (Phase 4 polish — the
user must type the target name verbatim before Approve unlocks):

- `delete_project` — type the project name
- `save_project` / `save_project_as` — type the target name (force-overwrite UX, v4-MAJOR-1 / v6-F1)
- `restore_project_snapshot` — type the snapshot id
- `cascade_delete_bus` — type the bus name

If the TTL elapses without a decision the stream emits a `tool_error` with
`error_kind='confirmation_expired'` — the agent re-prompts with a fresh
token. Approving an expired token via the REST endpoint returns 409
`error_kind='confirmation_expired'`.

## Error flows

The error banner above the message list recognises:

- `project_exists` — Save-As / save-with-force into a name that already
  exists. The card shows the typed-confirmation widget; type the existing
  project name to acknowledge the overwrite (v4-MAJOR-1 / v6-F1).
- `descendants_exist` — `delete_project` on a parent with scenarios. The
  agent prompts you for `cascade=true` before retrying (v4-MINOR-1).
- `confirmation_expired` — TTL elapsed before Approve / Deny.
- `rate_limited` — Anthropic 429 or `RateLimitError`. The agent backs off.
- `unauthorized` — Anthropic rejected the API key. Update and retry.
- `missing_api_key` — `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` not set in the backend env.

The `cold_path` activate is **not** an error — the banner self-dismisses
to keep the conversation clean (v6-F2).

## Multi-tab safety

`chat.jsonl` is mutexed per-project via `ProjectContext.chat_state.lock`,
so two browser tabs writing to the same project produce a coherent,
non-torn file (M9). Rotation happens under the same lock (v4-MINOR-2), so
two tabs crossing the 5 MiB rotation threshold near-simultaneously yield
exactly one `chat.jsonl.1` backup rather than corrupting either file.

The lock does **not** prevent two tabs from each holding their own
in-memory `ChatSession`. Confirmation tokens are per-session; if you
approve a confirmation in tab A, tab B's UI still shows the card until
the session it's on issues its own next turn. This is by design — every
tool dispatch is authorized by exactly one card.

## Lineage rules (Phase 4)

`chat.jsonl` follows the project across every save / clone / snapshot
transition:

| Transition | Behaviour |
|---|---|
| Routine re-save (loaded == name) | no change |
| Save-As (`?rebind=true`) | chat.jsonl **moved** to new project dir; cache invalidated |
| Save-a-Copy (`?rebind=false`) | chat.jsonl **copied** to new project dir; active session continues on the source |
| `create_scenario` | chat.jsonl **copied** to scenario dir |
| `rename_project` | filesystem rename handles the file; persist_path cache invalidated |
| `create_project_snapshot` | chat.jsonl **included** in snapshot bundle |
| `restore_project_snapshot` | active chat.jsonl **overwritten** from snapshot bundle; cache invalidated |

All lineage operations are best-effort: a failure copying chat history
NEVER aborts the underlying project save / rename / restore.

## What the assistant cannot do

- Mutate components while a solver run is in flight — the backend's
  middleware returns 409 for any POST/PUT/PATCH/DELETE under
  `/api/network/*` during a solve. The agent gets the same answer.
- Run two destructive tools in one turn (M7). The runtime emits
  `parallel_destructive_not_allowed` for each offender and asks the agent
  to retry serially.
- Drive Snakemake workflows. The v6 scope is the pypsa-gui REST surface
  only.
- Cross-tab session sharing — each tab has its own session_id and its
  own confirmation tokens.

## Security notes

- The API key never reaches the frontend. `/api/chat/health` reports
  only a boolean presence flag.
- `_redact_for_log` strips both the literal `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` value AND
  any substring matching `sk-ant-*` before logging.
- `chat.jsonl` is gitignored via the existing `backend/projects/` rule.
- Confirmation tokens are server-stamped, single-use, TTL'd, and never
  surface in URLs.
